Hello, this is my personal portfolio repo

### How to deploy:

1. npm run deploy

This command will create a branch named gh-pages in this repository or updates it if it already exists. This branch hosts the app and homepage property I created in package.json file holds the link for a live preview.

2. To serve the app from a custom domain: Go to the settings page of the repo and reset the custom domain name to gayathribalasubramani.com
